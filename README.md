The Deflate algorithm was used for data compression in this scenario for the following reasons:

1. Widely Supported: The Deflate algorithm is a widely supported and commonly used compression algorithm. It is a combination of LZ77 (Lempel-Ziv 77) for dictionary-based compression and Huffman coding for lossless data compression. It is used in popular file formats such as ZIP and GZIP, making it a familiar and well-documented choice.

2. Efficient Compression: The Deflate algorithm provides good compression ratios for a wide range of data types. It is capable of effectively reducing the size of the data, which can be especially beneficial in scenarios where the message size needs to be minimized for efficient transmission and storage.

3. Fast Compression and Decompression: The Deflate algorithm is designed to be relatively fast in terms of compression and decompression speed. While the exact performance can vary depending on the implementation and the size and characteristics of the data being compressed, Deflate is generally considered to be reasonably efficient in terms of processing time.

4. Simplicity and Ease of Integration: The Deflate algorithm is relatively simple to understand and implement. It involves a straightforward process of compressing and decompressing data using a combination of LZ77 and Huffman coding. This simplicity makes it easier to integrate into the existing codebase without introducing excessive complexity.

5. Compatibility: The Deflate algorithm is widely supported across different programming languages and platforms. This ensures that the compressed messages can be easily exchanged and handled by various systems and applications.
